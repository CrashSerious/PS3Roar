************ PS3 Port of xroar ************

+= Introduction to PS3Roar =+

PS3roar is a Tandy Colour Computer (CoCo) models 1 & 2 emulator that runs on a wide variety of platforms,
now including the PS3. Due to hardware similarities, PS3roar also emulates the Dragon 32 and 64 Computer.
The PS3 port and modifications completed by CrashSerious. The PS3 port uses PSl1GHT, a free and 
Open Source SDK for the PS3.

PS3roar - a Dragon/Tandy Coco emulator, is a port of xRoar by Ciaran Anscomb.
xRoar is Copyright (C) 2003-2010 Ciaran Anscomb <xroar@6809.org.uk>

This document just contains extracts from the manual covering installation of XRoar from source.
If you downloaded a binary package,the full manual should have been supplied with it as a PDF, 
which you can consult for more details.  Binary packages and an online copy of the documentation
are available from the XRoar home page (http://www.6809.org.uk/dragon/xroar.shtml).

***This emulator does not function completely at the moment. It is a WIP.***

+= Known issues =+

	- Sound (Sound is there, but not 100% correct)


+= Keyboard commands: =+

PS3roar's user interface is based around SDL. The emulator video output window is shown, and all
operations are performed with keyboard combinations, usually accessed as Control+KEY. The following are
the keyboard combinations for the functions listed:

-= Loading Files =-
Control+I			Insert a ROM cartridge.
Control+Shift+I		Insert a ROM cartridge, no autorun.
Control+L			Load a cassette file.
Control+Shift+L		Load a cassette file and attempt to autorun it where appropriate.
Control+W			Attach a virtual cassette file for writing.
Control+[1-4]			Insert a virtual disk into drive 1-4.
Control+Shift+[1-4]		Insert a blank virtual disk (40TSS) into drive 1-4.
Control+[5-8]			Toggle write enable on disk in drive 1-4.
Control+Shift+[5-8]		Toggle write back on disk in drive 1-4.
Control+S			Save a snapshot.
Control+Shift+S		Load a snapshot.

-= System Control Keys =-
Control+R			Soft reset emulated machine.
Control+Shift+R		Hard reset emulated machine.
Control+C			Quit emulator (Power Off).

-= Emulation Configuration Keys =-
Control+K			Toggle between Dragon and CoCo keyboard layout. See Keyboard.
Control+A			Cycle through cross-colour video modes (hi-res only).
Control+M			Cycle through emulated machine types (resets machine).
Control+E			Toggle DOS emulation on/off - reset to take effect.
Control+J			Cycle through joystick emulation modes (None, Left, Right).
Control+Shift+J		Swap joystick mapping (left/right).
Control+Z			Enable keyboard translation mode.
Control+F			Switch from and back to Full screen mode.
F12				While held, the emulator will run at the maximum possible speed. 
Control+U			Create and copy from folders on USB for ROMS, CAS, DSK, BIOS, etc.

+= ROMS information =+

The emulator is distributed with some software for the Color Computer II, it is distributed with:

Dungeons of Daggorath, per the license below:
	http://iloveglory.freehostia.com/daggorath/license.html

To find other ROMS, and to find BIOS files; search google for the phrase, they are REQUIRED to get
the emulator working:

"color computer" roms

PS3Roar creates a folder structure on a USB drive that does not already contain a "PS3Roar" directory, the structure is:
	BIOS
	CASSETTES
	DISKS
	images
	ROMS
	SNAPSHOTS

These folders correspond to the folders in the installed PS3roar directory on the HDD. Placing fikles on the USB Stick, then anagin inserting
into the PS3 and pressing CONTROL+U once more will copy the files to the PS3. Once copied, the USB stick can be removed. Note: files are NEVER loaded from USB,
they must be on the internal HDD in the proper location. The CONTROL+U functionality makes this easy and removes the need to FTP files to the PS3.

+= Notes =+

- You will need to unzip the rom files. They need to be .rom files, the emulator doesn't deal with .zips
- You will need to get your own roms and (for now) place them in /dev_hdd0/game/PS3Roar00/USRDIR/ROMS/ to get the emulator
 "operational"
- Heavy reorganization was done to the original source code to accomodate easy PS3 compilation and creation of a PS3
  the original source code is in a .tar.gz in the original source code of this repository.
- The original readme has been left intact, and is named README.xroar
- Docs for the original can be found at http://www.6809.org.uk/dragon/xroar-manual.shtml
- (Xroar functions that are not to be implemented)
	Control+F
	    Toggle full screen mode.
	Control+T
	    Open the tape control window (certain user interfaces only). See Tape control.
	Control+Shift+P
	    Flush printer output. See Printing.
